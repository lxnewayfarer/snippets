### Rails, migrations, SQL
It is preffered to use SQL in migrations when you update older records because model and other classes may be changed in future (e. g. model's validations, callbacks, etc). So there is example of fine SQL query which uses regular expression to match two tables by name and set foreign key. And do not forget about double quoting (`\\`) because SQL query there is a string.
